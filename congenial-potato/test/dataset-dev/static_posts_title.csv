Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus
But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea
The European languages are members of the same family
Their separate existence is a myth
For science, music, sport, etc
Europe uses the same vocabulary
The languages only differ in their grammar
their pronunciation and their most common words
Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable
If several languages coalesce
The new common language will be more simple
Far far away behind the word mountains
A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul
One morning when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams
The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog
DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog
Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps
Bawds jog flick quartz vex nymphs
Waltz bad nymph for quick jigs vex!
Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz
Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox
Bright vixens jump
